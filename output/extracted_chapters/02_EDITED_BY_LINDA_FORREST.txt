This book is a combination of facts about the author’s life and recounts
   events and conversations to the best of the author’s memory. The
  conversations in the book all come from the author’s recollections,
   though they are not written to represent word-for-word transcripts.
Rather, the author has retold them in a way that evokes the feeling and
  meaning of what was said. While all the stories in this book are true,
     some dates, places, events, names, and identifying details of
individuals have been changed, invented, and altered for literary effect.
The reader should not consider this book anything other than a work of
                                literature.
