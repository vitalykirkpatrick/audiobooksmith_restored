My brother Slavik on the very left and sister Nadya at the front right
                        playing in the sand.

I DIDN’T REALIZE THAT MY EYES had closed when I first saw the
beautiful woman. I could see she was the kind of woman who knew
how to make you feel cherished and loved. In the dream, she was
looking at two little boys. One of them wrapped his arms around her,
clinging to her love. The boy’s skin was blonde and freckled,
illuminated by sunlight trying to break through the glass doors that
rested behind the woman’s eyes.

The woman’s skin was as dark as night, holding stars in her chest and
showing a thousand moons in her stiff smile. I could see the muscles
around her lips trembling as she worked to control the facade of
artificial kindness. From behind the woman’s eyes, the clinging boy
tried to wave, but he was trapped by her as if she was trying to keep
him only to herself.
